# Login and sign up system using HTML and PHP and CSS and Mysql

I working on my first project that's is creating a fitness website. It my very first project and i'm really exited. 
For this page, i'm trying to create a nice Login and sign up page with HTML Css and PHP. I've already done the most but i don't know why i keep getting a blank page and i try to register.
Noting come in the database
the output i shoud expecting is (Registration successful!). instead is getting me a blanck page and nothing happen. Nothing is the database. why I check the web server log files, nothing.

I also have the main page on the side but it look good for now. No error for now.
Also, I know my code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. like i said it my first real project and i still learning

If someone can help me optimize the login page and a more secure database to prevent SQL injection attacks, it will be really grateful. i want that to be looking good and secure for the client
